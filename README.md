A series about Jupyter notebooks collating some work done using the NHL's game-date API, originally intended to be centralized on a blog or similar.

Portions of code undoubtedly borrowed from [dword4](https://github.com/dword4/nhlapi) and their incredibly helpful work centralizing documentation and sample use cases for the API's various endpoints. 

Notebook 1: Working with the NHL API
Notebook 2: Visualizing data from the NHL API
Notebook 3: Using game data to predict shot type
